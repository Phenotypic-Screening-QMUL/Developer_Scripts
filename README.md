# Developer_Scripts

Developer is high content analysis software that has for the most part been replaced in the facility by InCarta. 

Whilst not as user friendly as InCarta, it provides a greater degree of control and can often be used for more bespoke or less standard quantifications.

### 1_Importing Data
Developer outputs csv files that are not formated well for easy import into R.

This script prodvides a way of getting round these issues and can be used as a template for your own data. 

### 2_Developer Basic Plotting
A guide for importing summary data and generating bar charts, error bars and t-tests

### 3_Plotting Single Target Data
A guide for population based plots (histrograms, frequency distributions) that makes use of the single target data output by developer

**Guides for following this code (along with the raw data) are available on the facility Teams Hub in the "04 - Bioinformatics Script Repository" folder or can be downloaded from the "Walkthrough Guides" folder and opened in your web browser.**
